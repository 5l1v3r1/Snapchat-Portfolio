    <h2> <center> Introduction </center> </h2> <br>
    <p> Hello, my name is Sebastian Cevallos and I'm 18. I have been interested in computers since I was a child. It began
      with videogames and branched out when I learned about programming through the popular game Minecraft.
      I got really interested in web development and designed a few simple websites in HTML before I learned
      about lower level programming languages like Python, Java and C++. <br><br>
      At this point I was in highschool, at fifteen I began studying Python and created my first "Hello World"
      program. I got really interested in Cyber Security and put lots of time learning about Virtual Machines,
      computer networking topics like the OSI Model, and penetration testing tools like the operating system
      Kali Linux. <br><br>
      When I turned 16, I took AP Computer Science which covered Java. This was one of my favorite classes,
      and at that point I had decided I wanted a career in Computer Science, and eventually either become
      a software developer or a penetration tester. I finished AP Computer Science with a 98%, enjoying
      every second of it and obtaining a far deeper understanding about how actual programming works. <br><br>
      When I was 17, I began independently creating several projects using Java, and began trying to study
      C++ on my own. I learned how to upload my projects to my Github and got ready for college. <br><br>
      When I turned 18, I took an Introduction to Computer Science class that covered C++ and graduated
      with an A. This furthered my understanding of C++ and really sparked an interest in lower level
      languages. Next year, I'm planning on taking an advanced class on C++ at Pasadena City College. Now,
      With my new applications for internships over the summer I'm putting time into web development. I
      have been studying CSS and HTML, and uploading all of my work using Amazon Web Services because I
      know it's practicality in the industry.

  <div class="goals">
    <h2> <center> Goals </center> </h2>
    <p> Each year I give myself a list of goals that I have to work to completing by my next birthday. This
      started when I was 16 and landed my first job, when I told myself I would save $10,000 before I turned
      17. The craziest part to me was that I did it. <br> <br>
      <img src="img/10k.jpg" class="moneyImg"> <br> <br>
      The following year, I told myself I would do the following before/when I turned 18... <br>
      <li> Begin investing money into the stock market    (Using Robinhood) </li>
      <li> Open up a Roth & Traditional IRA <span> &#10003; </span> (Using JPMorgan)</li>
      <li> Get a credit card to begin a new credit line <span> &#10003; </span> (Using Discover) </li>
      <li> Register to vote <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
      <li> Learn how to sport climb <span> &#10003; </span> (rock climbing) </li>
      <li> Learn how to surf <span> &#10003; </span> (Totaled 3 seconds on my feet)</li>
      <li> Learn how to play poker <span> &#10003; </span> (Found a new hobby) </li>
      <li> Make a will &#x2717; (Not yet) </li>
      <li> Register for a Series 6 investing license &#x2717; (Did research, found out I didn't want it) </li>
      <br> When I turned 18 and realized all the different skills I had acquired (even if I didn't finish all of them),
      I was really impressed and decided to try it again for when I turned 19. On June 22, 2020, I wanted to be able to
      say I have... <br><br>
      <li> Typed at 120 WPM <span> &#10003; </span> (Typed at 123) </li>
      <li> Acheived a credit score of 720 <span> &#10003; </span> (Current score is 138) </li>
      <li> Finished a course on Microsoft Excel (In progress) </li>
      <li> Done three one-arm chin-ups in a row <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
      <li> Finished the school year with a GPA above 3.2 (In progress) </li> <br>
      <li> Read the following books: </li>
        <li> The Iliad <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
        <li> The Odyssey <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
        <li> The Aneid <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
        <li> Nichomachean Ethics <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
        <li> 1984 <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
        <li> Fahrenheit 451 <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
        <li> The Bell Jar <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
        <li> Caffeine <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
        <li> Atomic Habits <span> &#10003; </span> (Great read!) </li>
        <li> One Up on Wallstreet <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
        <li> The Checklist Manifesto <span> &#10003; </span> </li>
      <br>Clearly, the strategy of creating goals is working. I'm excited, as my deadline is coming up close.
      By June 22nd, I should be done with all of my new goals and look forward to setting more for the future.
