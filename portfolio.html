      <p><br> I began posting my projects on <a href="https://github.com/Sebastian-git" target="_blank"> Github </a> several years ago, but only recently decided
      to start updating them with images and thorough descriptions. I have years of experience in Python and java, and have recently begun studying C++.
      Now that I am learning more HTML and CSS, I will begin updating my Github with these projects.
      I removed all previous projects that I thought weren't worth showing off. Over breaks, I try my best to create as many fun projects as possible to add to
      my repository. Although my home page isn't very filled up yet, there are several more high quality projects to come. Currently, I am working with Python's text to speach libraries to try
      to create a voice assistant. All projects mentioned will be on my Github </p>

        <br> <p> This is one example of one of the project's I have decided to upload to Github.
        I created this nearly two years ago using Java. I created a chat communication program
        that used the Javafx library to create a GUI. I then made a class for the client and server
        to connect to each other using sockets. The program could use a lot of work and I look forward
        giving it an upgrade in the future to refresh my knowledge in Java. </p>

      <h1> <center> Flashcards </center> </h1>
      <div class="rowTwo">
        <img src="img/flashcardsImg.png" class="flashcardsImg">
        <br> <p> This Flashcards program was written in Python nearly three years ago. This program used
        tkinter to display the GUI to a mock-flashcard program. You can create a new Flash card by typing
        into the text-entries, which then is saved to a file. The program can then read from the file and
        display the customized flash cards using tkinter. </p>
