  <h2> <center> Summary </center></h2> <br>
    <p> Although Snapchat attracts the youth the most, it's audience is constantly growing. <br><br>
    According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/" target="_blank"> Statista, <a> Snapchat has
    229 million daily active users! That's only 100 million less than the population of the United States of America! <br><br>
    Following <a href="https://kit.snapchat.com/news/snap-kit-sdk-1-4" target="_blank"> Snapchat's SDK </a> (Software Development Kit),
    over 210 million snaps are created on Snapchat every day! <br><br>
    Another interesting statistic released by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/326460/snapchat-global-gender-group/" target="_blank">
    Statista </a> is that 61% of Snapchat users are female, and 39% are male. </p>

  <h2> <center> Key Features </center> </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Camera Communication </li>
      <p> Snapchat takes advantage of the camera to add a new dimension <br>
      to communication, letting people share the world through their own <br>
      eyes. This inspires creativity in communication that can even be <br>
      enhanced through the multiple stickers, emojis, drawings and gifs <br>
      that are offered. </p>
      <li> Discover Page </li>
      <p> The discover page allows users to get lost in a new world <br>
      filled with customized information. In the discover page, you <br>
      can view stories from your friends, subscribe to news channels <br>
      and find new content to follow.</p>
      <li> Streaks </li>
      <p> Creating an almost addicting incentive to stay active on the <br>
      social media application was one of the most effective forms to <br>
      retain daily users. The more people chat on the app, the more <br>
      feedback the app gives them!
      <li> Score </li>
      <p> The more people you talk to, the higher your score goes. Or, <br>
      more specifically, your score is the combined number of "Snaps" <br>
      you have sent and received (not counting stories). </p>
    </ul>
